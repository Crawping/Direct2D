## 1.Direct2DTests

### D2DBezierToWave
This project is a test about rendering waveform using bezier in Direct2D.

### D2DCollisionDetectionBetweenGeometrys
This project is about collision detection between two geometrys.</br>

### D2DFPS
This project is a test about fps in Direct2D.

### D2DGeometricTranslationOrder
This project shows that the different order of geometric translation lead to different result.</br>
The right order is 'scale -> rotate -> translate'in the geometric translation.

### D2DGeometryCollisionDetectionWithPt
This project is about collision detection between point and geometry object.</br>

### D2DTMPL
This project is the template of my Direct2D codes.

### DWriteCustomFont
This project is a test about custom font in DirectWrite.</br>
In this project, We can directly use custom font files instead of loading to project resource file.</br>
And we don't have to use system font files to render text.</br>
The method is using path geometry instead of text format. We create path geometry from custom font file and string. After that,we just render the path geometry.

### DWriteStringTrimming
This project is about string trimming in DirectWrite.</br>
